## Library Management System

This is a command-line interface application that mimics a real world application as close as possible. Instead of using custom data structures like I did before, I am rewriting the entire codebase to utilize data structures in the C++ STL and integrating with a database (PostGreSQL).

### How to run
- Create a ```build``` directory from the project root directory
- Go into the ```build``` directory and enter command ```cmake ..```
- enter the ```make``` command after cmake runs successfully
- To run the program, enter ```./library-management```
